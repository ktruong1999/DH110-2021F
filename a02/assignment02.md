### assignment02 : Usability Testing of the Washington State Agriculture Website
#### Introduction
---
The Washington State Agriculture Website contains information on programs in Washington for food security access, permits, food certification, and more. I was interested in this website particuluarly because I care a lot about food insecurity and proper UX can be impactful to helping individuals in need of food access resources.

##### Purpose of Usability Testing
After conducting a heuristic evaluation of the website, I narrowed down my top usability concerns that I wanted to confirm by testing with a participant. I wanted to see if the problems I identified would disrupt a participant's experience when completing a task. Specifically I was interested in seeing how the participant's experience would be affected by the problems I identified in aesthetics, consistency and standards, and flexibility. This usability test is to evaluate the Washing State's Agriculutre Website based on effectivenes, efficiency, and satisfaction of completing tasks.  

#### Methodology 
---
This usability test will be conducted remotely over Zoom. As the moderator I will be conducting the study in a quiet room of my apartment while my participant does similar.

This study will be done fully remote, the participant and I will be calling from our seperate homes. We will start with an overview of Usability Testing and then gather the participant's informed consent. The participant will then give their opinions about the website and complete 3 tasks to evaluate the website's usability. The participant will provide their feedback on the difficulty to complete the task, their satisfaction, and other comments they have on the website

This usability test is intneded as a pilot study

#### Reflection 
--- 
I found the UT session very helpful in validating problems I found in the heuristic evaluation. I was concerned that aesthetic problems was not actually a high priority usability error like I had thought before. When going over tasks with my particpant, aesthetics were a prominent factor in his user expereince that he mentioned felt disruptive. Receiving the feedback through testing was very confirming that aesthetics are a high priority usability problem. Through the UT we actually found a problem I didn't anticipate beforehand, which highlighted the website's issues with information hierarchy. 

I think the remote UT went fairly smoothly with only minor distractions. I feel that at some parts my voice showed some nervousness or the backgorund noise of my aptartment may have been distruptive. In the future I think I could improve by praciticing the scripts more before the UT and conducting studies in a professional environment. I think I could have probed the participant more to talk aloud while they're doing the task, but I think we were still about to capture his opinions in the task reflections. Overall, I think during this session we were able to reflect well on the user's thoughts and I can further improve on my professional moderating skills.
