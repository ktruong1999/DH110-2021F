# DH 110 Assignment 3 : Contextual Inquiry
## Kelly Truong | DH 110 | Fall 2021 

## Introductory Steps
### Step 01: Specify the main design challenge
---
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
This project aims to empower users to find ways to combat food insecurity within their communities. For this project I want to understand how the website interface can affect findability for community resources and how information can be made more accessible. With improvements to the website I feel that it could motivate users to seek out ways they can contribute to their community through volunteering or gaining awareness. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity fulfills the love and social belonging basic need for the user. Being able to help one’s community helps to foster a sense of togetherness by supporting others. This activity could also support the basic need for esteem, since volunteering is a way to gain respect from others through selfless action. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Traditionally users seek out volunteering to satisfy their belonging and esteem needs by finding their local food bank. Users would usually have to discover nearby volunteering opportunities through word of mouth or research on their own. Users might also find out about opportunities from events hosted by their school or work that give attention to food security programs. Food security programs and resources are also usually announced to people when they start at a new job or new school, which is another way a person could find out how to volunteer. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Currently, discoverability of volunteering opportunities is limited to mainly word of mouth or outdated search interfaces. Volunteering is usually out of a person’s free time outside of school or work, so it is important to be able to find opportunities that are close in proximity and flexible with time. With digital improvements the volunteer search process could be optimized and could further encourage users to volunteer to foster both their esteem and belonging along with supporting their community. 

### Step 02: Target Users
---
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographic : people interested in community empowerment and social issues. The age range can vary from college age to older adults. Typically very empathetic and helpful people.
Preferences : Users would prefer to help others when they can
Expertise : No expertise required 

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Food security volunteering opportunities can be found throughout the user's state. There are many local food banks under the Feeding America Organization as well as many campus initiated food access services. Users would usually go to their local foodbank or food program within school or work to volunteer or learn more. Searching for volunteering events can either be from word of mouth or from user's actively searching on their own, which is why a good interface is essential.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet for food bank volunteering options nearby, or they may start from a program or ogranization they already know about.

### Step 03: Research Method

I chose to do Participatory Observation for this session. I perpared tasks for my participant to perform relating to food security and volunteering while we talked through their though their thoght process and reactions

#### Quotes
<b>what is the most difficult part about finding ways to volunteer for food security?</b> @35:55
> being able to find an organization that is close enough, but also like, information that like the information about that, or like that volunteer opportunity has to be like, readily available, like earlier, there was just like to email us or reach out to people about so it's, like, kind of inconvenient when you have to do that.

<b>What are other factors to consider when deciding to volunteer?</b> @37:00
> Well, like I said, proximity, yeah, yeah, proximity, like timing, like it has to fit into my schedule, and then like, credibility of the organization. And then I guess like also, like what exactly I would be doing I kind of want to know like that ahead of time, before blindly signing myself up.

<b>Can you tell me what you enjoy about volunteering and how it makes you feel?</b> @40:00
>It feels rewarding to see your hard work benefitting people that need assistance, I think thats the biggest motivating factor in volunteering...being able to help someone even if you don't have the financial resources to donate, at least you can do something through your efforts.

### Reflection
---
I think the session went well overall and could be improved with minor adjustments to the script and more practice moderating/interviewing. I found it very insightful to break down the process of searching for resources. It was hard to think of how to phrase the questions but I think during the interview it came more naturally to elaborate more on some parts. My participant mentioned a main deterrent was proximity of programs and how descriptive opportunities were. Volunteering opportunities could be more accessible by providing more transparency on location, timing, and activity. I thought it was very powerful that the user expressed intrigue in the topic after our session especially since their colleague utilizes food access programs which helped them realize how many people can be affected. From this session I can see that this is a topic that can reach many people and improvements to opportunity discoverability could help users overcome barriers to volunteering more.
