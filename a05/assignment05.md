# DH150 Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Kelly Truong | DH 110 | Fall 2021 

### Purpose of Lofi Prototyping
Low fidelity prototypes are useful to quickly test ideas at a low cost to test with users before investing in building a full product. Testing a low fidelity prototype also helps get feedback early on from users on features and usability. 

### About the Project
The state website I chose to redesign is the Washington State agriculture website food access page. The website could be used for both users seeking assistance in food security or users interested in volunteering opportunities. Good UX is important for this website because it is a method of outreach for users who want to combat food insecurity. 

### User Research 
Based on my user research from my contextual inquiry, I will be focussing on the following research questions
<ol>
  <li>How might we increase visibility for food access resources and opportunities </li>
  <li>How might we improve findability for food access resources? </li>
  <li> How might we show proximity of opportunities better?</li>
</ol>

### Personas and Scenarios
I created personas and scenarios relating to the research questions
<ul>
  <li><b>Marina Hernandez - </b> a young adult community college student looking to volunteer with her free time</li>
  <li><b>Cindy Cowell - </b> a middle aged single mother to two children looking for resources on food access that are flexible and accommodating </li>
 </ul>

### A list of  features that the (paper) prototype of your system supported.
<ul>
  <li>Search radius by zip code and distance</li>
  <li>Filtering system</li>
  <li> Tagging system for resources and opportunities</li>
</ul>

### Tasks
<ol>
  <li>Search for a food access center within 2 miles of the zip code 90024 </li>
  <li>Filter to find centers that offer volunteer opportunities</li>
</ol>

### Wireframes and Wireflows

### Low-Fidelity Prototype Testing
#### Task 1 : initial search

> I thought the participant might have been confused by the entry point for finding a food access center, I intended for either the headline or the "learn more" link to take the user to the next screen. My participant recognized the headline as a link because of the underlining, and expected the "learn more" link to be like a dropdown for information.
> I was also surprised the participant didn't follow the flow to fill out the zip code and slider one at a time. She expected that both fields would be filled and that a submit button would be used to take her to the results page after
#### Task 1 : search results

> My participant couldn't tell the difference between screens 3 and 4, they were intended to be different results pages that change instantaneously whenever the zip code or slider is changed. She was also confused by the tag acronyms
#### Task 2 : filtering for volunteer opportunities
![image 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68669305/140387817-020298fc-89ab-4b72-8425-5df39cab507c.png)
> my participant's initial reaction was to tap on the "VOLUNTEER" tag on one of the cards, she said she expected to see the page change to see other cards with the volunteer tag. Afterwards she tried the filter icon, her only comment was to make the dropdown into an overlay instead for bigger tap areas and to prevent misclicks. 
> The last screen she found a mistake that one opportunity does not have the volunteer tag and also commented on a way to escape back to the home screen. The back arrow in the top left was intended to take the user back to the home page, but the participant thought it was to go back to the previous screen.
### Reflection
When designing the wireframes I was very uncertain what kind of feedback I'd get, I thought the tasks were straightforward and I wouldn't get much feedback. To my surprise my participant had a lot of feedback on her expectations of the flow. 

To improve I'd want to add a button to confirm the search criteria to show users the different search results clearly. Maybe I could also use a help button in the top corner to explain the tag acronyms. I could also make the escape route clearer, labeling the top left arrow with a breadcrumb or adding a nav bar with a home button. Possibly another entry point to filter for volunteer opportunities could be to tap the "VOLUNTEER" tag on any of the cards.

Overall it was helpful to see how differently wireframes at this stage can be interpreted. Talking with my participant really helped me compare the flow of my app compared to others, and realize other ways to increase efficiency.
