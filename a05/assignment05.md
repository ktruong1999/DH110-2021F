# DH150 Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Kelly Truong | DH 110 | Fall 2021 

### Purpose of Lofi Prototyping
Low fidelity prototypes are useful to quickly test ideas at a low cost to test with users before investing in building a full product. Testing a low fidelity prototype also helps get feedback early on from users on features and usability. 

### About the Project
The state website I chose to redesign is the Washington State agriculture website food access page. The website could be used for both users seeking assistance in food security or users interested in volunteering opportunities. Good UX is important for this website because it is a method of outreach for users who want to combat food insecurity. 

### User Research 
Based on my user research from my contextual inquiry, I will be focussing on the following research questions
<ol>
  <li>How might we increase visibility for food access resources and opportunities </li>
  <li>How might we improve findability for food access resources? </li>
  <li> How might we show proximity of opportunities better?</li>
</ol>

### Personas and Scenarios
I created personas and scenarios relating to the research questions
<ul>
  <li><b>Marina Hernandez - </b> a young adult community college student looking to volunteer with her free time</li>
  <li><b>Cindy Cowell - </b> a middle aged single mother to two children looking for resources on food access that are flexible and accommodating </li>
 </ul>

### A list of  features that the (paper) prototype of your system supported.
<ul>
  <li>Search radius by zip code and distance</li>
  <li>Filtering system</li>
  <li> Tagging system for resources and opportunities</li>
</ul>

### Tasks
<ol>
  <li>Search for a food access center within 2 miles of the zip code 90024 </li>
  <li>Filter to find centers that offer volunteer opportunities</li>
</ol>
