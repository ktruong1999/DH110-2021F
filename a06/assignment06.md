# DH150 Assignment 6: Interface Design
## Kelly Truong | DH 110 | Fall 2021 

### Brief Summary
---
This interface design was made to improve on the features explored in the low fidelity prototype after it was tested with participants. The interface design helps to create a more finished looking product, and help for further testing with more realistic feedback.
This interface design is for an app interface of the Washington Agriculture Food Access Page. This app would be used for individuals seeking resources to combat food insecurity in a variety of ways such as seeking food assistance or searching for volunteer opporutnities. 
This design was made entirely on Figma, an online interface and interaction design tool. I also utilized websites like Adobe Color and plugins like Stark for different phases of the project.

### Screen Design

#### Typography Variations
![typography variations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68669305/140873538-608d707a-b4be-41c5-969b-20102faeb335.png)
<br> I experimented with the typography to find a font combination where the display font would have good hierarchal contrast to the body font. I also looked specifically for fonts with sans serif because I liked the clean look.I also took inspiration from the fonts on the original website.

<br> For my final font choice I chose Montserrat as the display font and Open Sans as the body font. I think Montserrat has a distinctly different font face since it is a lot blockier than Open Sans, providing a lot of contrast. I scaled the font size aroudn the base font size 16px for the body font using a scale of x1.5 to go up for the heading and down for the button size, then x2 for the title font size.

#### Shape Variations

<br> this screen is an example of the shape variations I have throughout this design. I played around with different border radiuses depending on what the shape was used for. I like making tags pill shaped since they are small, but a high border radius for the entire card would look off.
#### Color Scheme Variations

<br> Using Adobe Color's theme extractor I took the logo for the Washington State Government Website and used it's main colors. I experimented with tinting the system black and white with blue green to match with the accent color. I also played around with the brightness of the accent color so that it would stand out when used mnimally.

#### Layout Test

<br> Layouts have always been very hard for me but I managed to find a layout system that fits the content well enough. I made the side margins 32px since I didn't have a lot of content that would get stretched out a lot over a wide screen. I think the alignment on both sides helps draw the eye to explore the screen.

<br> Originally I used the tinted design system white as the title font color but it failed the WCAG AA score. I swapped out the color for the design system black which increased the WCAG score a lot and I think it also looks easier on the eyes and more readable this way.

#### Design System Reflection
Overall I feel like I was able to create a very clean design system. I think my font choices were very concise and show a good level of hierarchy that helps communicate purpose in my screen designs. I really liked the colors that were generated and that tinting the system white and balck helped make the design more cohesive. My biggest struggle was the layout design because it can be hard to adjust a set font size around layout rows that aren't adjusted directly
