### Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is important to understand the role of how your product will serve the user. It is essential to take the perspective of the user to build products that are designed with HCD principles in mind. The use of personas can help eliminate biases as a researcher by using the typical userâ€™s point of view. 

### New UX Features
<b>1) Distance Radius Slider -</b> a slider that can increase the search range for resources so users can adjust the proximity of their resources

<b>2) Tagging and Filtering -</b> information about local programs organized in tags for resources or volunteering opportunities, and a filtering system to narrow down the user's search to be more specific

### Reflection 
* It was harder than I thought it'd be to create personas that would each serve a unique use case. Especially since food security is a sensitive topic I tried to be very mindful about how to describe a persona that would utilize resources for food access. 
* Coming up with new features was also a challenge, it took some thinking to decide on what feature could add to the current interface. In the end I think the features I came pu with addressed the needs I found from the conextual inquiry and Usability Pilot
* I also really enjoyed designing the infographics for persona/empathy map/user journey
