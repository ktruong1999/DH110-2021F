# DH150 Assignment 7 : Interactive Prototype
## Kelly Truong | DH 110 | Fall 2021 

### About the project
---
I'm continuing my redesign of the Washington State Food Access page in hopes that UX would add to the user's experience accessing food resources or opportunities. At this stage I've made the prototype interactable, using smart animate and overlays to simulate how the finished product would operate. This stage is important to get the most accurage feedback about the flow, UI, copywriting, etc. This prototype was built off of my low fidelity prototype and interface design assignment, with more detail added to each screen to mimic a real app.

#### Prototype Features
<ol>
  <li>Learn about food access</li>
  <li>search for food resources, food banks, food programs, etc.</li>
  <li>filter for specific programs or volunteer opporutnities</li>
</ol>

Comments from the cognitive walkthrough with participants can be found throughout the prototype in comment mode (c).

#### Summary 
I collected feedback from 2 participants during our class activity. I think the session went well, I always learn more than I expect. I always go into sessions thinking theres nothing else the participant can think of besides what I already provided, but being able to understand why some things are confusing helps to think of solutions. My participants had really good suggestions on ways to improve the flow. For the home screen i got some feedback that the link previews aren't very descriptive of the activity for each page, my users suggested tags under each link while I think better copywriting could suggest the interaciton as well. I've gotten multiple comments that the resource tag acronyms are also confusing, based on this I would add an interaction to hold/hover over a tag to reveal the full name as a tooltip. From suggestions I also think it could be helpful to seperate the search for finding food resources vs finding volunteer opporutnities or improve copywriting to suggest you can search for either.
